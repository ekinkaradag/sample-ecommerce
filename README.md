# E-Commerce Website

This is an e-commerce website I built with [React](https://reactjs.org/). The sole purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills on my portfolio.

## To run it on your machine locally

Navigate to the project folder and run these commands on your machine in order:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then you can view the website on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
